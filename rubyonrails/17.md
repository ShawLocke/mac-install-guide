## Where to Get Help

Your best source for online help with problems is [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails). Your issue may have been encountered and addressed by others.

To find a real person who can help, attend a Ruby meetup in your city. Google for "ruby meetup" with your city name.
