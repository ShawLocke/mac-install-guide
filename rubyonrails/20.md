## Install Ruby and Node with Homebrew

Here are instructions for installing Ruby with Homebrew, as well as Node and Yarn (needed for Rails). Complete the section, [Install Homebrew](/rubyonrails/3.html), before you start.

Ruby 3.1.0 is the Ruby latest version (released Dec 25, 2021). As of Jan 1, 2022, Homebrew installed Ruby 3.0.3. Check the [Homebrew Ruby current version](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruby) to see if a newer Ruby is installed by Homebrew. For the latest Ruby 3.1 version, you can use Homebrew to install a version manager and [Install Ruby with Frum](/ruby/14.html) or [Install Ruby with Asdf](/ruby/6.html).

### Steps

This is a complete guide to installing Ruby with Homebrew on a Mac.
- Update macOS.
- Install Homebrew.
- Install Ruby, Node and Yarn.
- Update settings in the `~/.zshrc` file (as needed).

### Who this is for

Use Homebrew to install Ruby if you are a casual user and won't be using Ruby frequently. For example:
- you are just learning the language;
- you are building only one project.

There are drawbacks to using a version of Ruby that is installed with Homebrew:
- Homebrew may update Ruby to a new version when you upgrade other Homebrew packages;
- you can't switch between multiple Ruby versions.

Most developers use a software version manager to install Ruby. It will help you manage multiple versions of Ruby. I recommend [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Asdf can manage versions of many languages, including Ruby and Node. Instructions for asdf are in the section, [Install Asdf Version Manager](/rubyonrails/5.html).

### Mac system Ruby

MacOS comes with a "system Ruby" pre-installed. MacOS Big Sur and Catalina include Ruby 2.6.3 which is not the newest version. It's a bad idea to use the Mac system Ruby. See the article [Do not use the MacOS system Ruby](https://mac.install.guide/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html). You can see the system Ruby with `which ruby` and `ruby -v`.

Leave the system Ruby in place and install the newest Ruby version using Homebrew.

## Install Homebrew

Complete the section, [Install Homebrew](/rubyonrails/3.html), before you start.

## Install Ruby

Use Homebrew to install the newest Ruby version.

```bash
$ brew install ruby
```

Youâ€™ll see diagnostic messages and progress updates.

### Configure the shell environment

You'll need to set the Homebrew-installed Ruby to take priority over the system Ruby. Also you'll need to set the `$PATH` environment variable to add the directory used for Ruby gems.

Edit the `~/.zshrc` file in your text editor. If you havenâ€™t installed a text editor, use the macOS TextEdit application. Hereâ€™s a shortcut to open the file in TextEdit from the Terminal:

```bash
$ open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Set the `$PATH` environment variable. Add this at the end of your `~/.zshrc` file. On Mac Intel:

```bash
if [ -d "/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

On Apple silicon:

```bash
if [ -d "/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

This sets the Homebrew-installed Ruby to a higher priority than the system Ruby and adds the directory used for Ruby gems.

Save the file.

ðŸš© Close and reopen the Terminal window for the changes to the `~/.zshrc` file to be recognized.

### Pin Ruby

Homebrew may update Ruby to a new version when you upgrade other Homebrew packages. If you don't want Homebrew's Ruby version to be replaced by a newer version, you can use `brew pin ruby` to prevent updates to Ruby.

```bash
$ brew pin ruby
```

There is no response or result from the command. And there is no diagnostic that indicates that Ruby is pinned. You'll simply see an error message when another Homebrew package tries to update Ruby.

### Confirm Ruby installation

Check the `$PATH` environment variable.

 ```bash
 $ echo $PATH
 /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
 ```

On Apple silicon, you'll see `/opt/homebrew/`. On Mac Intel, you'll see `/usr/local/`.

You can confirm that Homebrew installed Ruby with `brew list`.

```bash
$ brew list
==> Formulae
libyaml		openssl@1.1	readline	ruby
```

You can see a list of the dependencies installed for Ruby with `brew deps --tree --installed`.

```bash
$ brew deps --tree --installed
libyaml

openssl@1.1

readline

ruby
â”œâ”€â”€ libyaml
â”œâ”€â”€ openssl@1.1
â””â”€â”€ readline
```

Verify that the newest version of Ruby is installed with `ruby -v`.

When this was written, Ruby 3.0.0 was the newest version (released on Dec 25, 2020).

### Troubleshooting

If you see Ruby version 2.6.3, it is the system Ruby. Try closing and re-opening the terminal window.

If you need to uninstall Ruby, see the guide [Uninstall Ruby](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/9.html).

## Install Node and Yarn

Node and Yarn manage the JavaScript used by a Rails application. Unless you create backend-only (API) Rails applications, there will always be a little (and sometimes too much) JavaScript in your Rails application.

### Install Node

Youâ€™ll need to install Node, the server version of JavaScript, before you develop any Rails applications. Node must be installed on your computer to run JavaScript in the local development environment.

Early versions of Rails only required the Ruby language for development. More recently (after Rails 5.1), Rails uses Node to run the JavaScript build tool, Webpack, to bundle together any JavaScript files used in an application. Itâ€™s difficult to develop fullstack Rails applications without installing Node.

Itâ€™s easy to install Node with Homebrew. Alternatively, you can download and install Node directly from the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) website. Or you can [install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), the Node version manager, and use NVM to install Node. Both alternatives require changes to the `.zshrc` file, so itâ€™s easier to install Node with Homebrew.

Use Homebrew to install Node:

```bash
$ brew install node
```

To verify that Node is installed:

```bash
$ node --version
v15.4.0
```

You should see `v15.4.0` or newer.

### Install Yarn

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript. Itâ€™s similar to the better-known NPM (Node Package Manager). Itâ€™s used by Rails to manage JavaScript dependencies.

Use Homebrew to install Yarn:

```bash
$ brew install yarn
```

To verify that Yarn is installed:

```bash
$ yarn --version
v1.22.10
```

You should see `v1.22.10` or newer.

![](/assets/images/rubyonrails/brew-install-yarn.png)

The JavaScript build tools are now installed and ready.

### Next

Optimize the Ruby development environment by updating gems. See the [Update Gems](/rubyonrails/8.html) section.
