## Rails New

### Create a Workspace Folder

You'll need a convenient folder to store your Rails projects. You can give it any name, such as `code` or `projects`. For this tutorial, we'll call it `workspace`.

Create a projects folder and move into the folder:

```bash
$ mkdir workspace
$ cd workspace
```

This is where you'll create your Rails applications.

### Rails new

Here's how to create a simple Rails application.

```bash
$ rails new --minimal myapp
```

The `rails new` command generates the default Rails starter app. The option `--minimal` speeds up creation of a  Rails app, leaving out many Rails "extras" that are not needed for a simple application.

We'll name the new application `myapp`. You can give it another name you like.

You'll do all the work of developing your application inside the `myapp` folder, sometimes called the project root.

For a "smoke test" to see if everything runs, move into the `myapp` folder and run `rails -T` to display a list of Rake tasks.

```bash
$ cd myapp
$ rails -T
```

Run the application with the Rails server command:

```bash
$ rails server
```

Use your web browser to visit the application at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Use Control-c to stop the server.
