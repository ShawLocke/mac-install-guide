## Tips: Minimal Rails

### Minimal Rails

It's easier to gets started with Rails if you remove all the "extras" that are not commonly used, for the simplest possible Rails application.

```bash
$ rails new myapp --minimal
```

Here are all the extras `--minimal` skips:

- action_cable
- action_mailbox
- action_mailer
- action_text
- active_job
- active_storage
- bootsnap
- jbuilder
- spring
- system_tests
- turbolinks
- webpack
