## Install Ruby with Homebrew

Here are instructions for `brew install ruby`, or how to install Ruby with Homebrew.

Ruby 3.1.0 is the Ruby latest version (released Dec 25, 2021). As of Jan 1, 2022, Homebrew installed Ruby 3.0.3. For the latest Ruby 3.1 version use Homebrew to install a version manager and [Install Ruby with Frum](/ruby/14.html) or [Install Ruby with Asdf](/ruby/6.html).

### Steps

This is a complete guide to installing Ruby with Homebrew on a Mac.
- Update macOS.
- Install Homebrew.
- Install Ruby.
- Update settings in the `~/.zshrc` file (as needed).

### Who this is for

Use Homebrew to install Ruby if you are a casual user and won't be using Ruby frequently. For example:
- you are just learning the language;
- you are building only one project.

There are drawbacks to using a version of Ruby that is installed with Homebrew:
- Homebrew may update Ruby to a new version when you upgrade other Homebrew packages;
- you can't switch between multiple Ruby versions.

Most developers use a software version manager to install Ruby. It will help you manage multiple versions of Ruby. I recommend [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Asdf can manage versions of many languages, including Ruby and Node. See instructions, [Install Asdf](/ruby/5.html). If you will only develop in Ruby, I recommend Frum, the newest and fastest Ruby version manager. See [Install Ruby with Frum](/ruby/14.html).

### Mac system Ruby

MacOS comes with a "system Ruby" pre-installed. MacOS Monterey includes Ruby 2.6.8 which is not the newest version. It's a bad idea to use the Mac system Ruby. See the article [Do not use the MacOS system Ruby](/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html). You can see the system Ruby with `which ruby` and `ruby -v`.

Leave the system Ruby in place and install the newest Ruby version using Homebrew.

## Install Homebrew

Complete the section, [Install Homebrew](/ruby/3.html), before you start.

## Install Ruby

Use Homebrew to install the newest Ruby version.

```bash
$ brew install ruby
```

Youâ€™ll see diagnostic messages and progress updates.

### Configure the shell environment

You'll need to set the Homebrew-installed Ruby to take priority over the system Ruby. Also you'll need to set the `$PATH` environment variable to add the directory used for Ruby gems.

Edit the `~/.zshrc` file in your text editor. If you havenâ€™t installed a text editor, use the macOS TextEdit application. Hereâ€™s a shortcut to open the file in TextEdit from the Terminal:

```bash
$ open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Set the `$PATH` environment variable. Add this at the end of your `~/.zshrc` file. On Mac Intel:

```bash
if [ -d "/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

On Apple silicon:

```bash
if [ -d "/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

This sets the Homebrew-installed Ruby to a higher priority than the system Ruby and adds the directory used for Ruby gems.

Save the file.

ðŸš© Close and reopen the Terminal window for the changes to the `~/.zshrc` file to be recognized.

### Pin Ruby

Homebrew may update Ruby to a new version when you upgrade other Homebrew packages. If you don't want Homebrew's Ruby version to be replaced by a newer version, you can use `brew pin ruby` to prevent updates to Ruby.

```bash
$ brew pin ruby
```

There is no response or result from the command. And there is no diagnostic that indicates that Ruby is pinned. You'll simply see an error message when another Homebrew package tries to update Ruby.

### Confirm Ruby installation

Check the `$PATH` environment variable.

 ```bash
 $ echo $PATH
 /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
 ```

On Apple silicon, you'll see `/opt/homebrew/`. On Mac Intel, you'll see `/usr/local/`.

You can confirm that Homebrew installed Ruby with `brew list`.

```bash
$ brew list
==> Formulae
libyaml		openssl@1.1	readline	ruby
```

You can see a list of the dependencies installed for Ruby with `brew deps --tree --installed`.

```bash
$ brew deps --tree --installed
libyaml

openssl@1.1

readline

ruby
â”œâ”€â”€ libyaml
â”œâ”€â”€ openssl@1.1
â””â”€â”€ readline
```

Verify that the newest version of Ruby is installed with `ruby -v`.

When this was written, Ruby 3.1.0 was the newest version (released on Dec 25, 2021).

### Troubleshooting

If you see Ruby version 2.6.8, it is the system Ruby. Try closing and re-opening the terminal window.

If you need to uninstall Ruby, see the guide [Uninstall Ruby](/ruby/9.html).

### Next

Optimize the Ruby development environment by updating gems. See the [Update Gems](/ruby/7.html) section next.
